# Dynamic QR-Codes for EU AFIR

This project provides reference implementations for generating **Dynamic QR-Codes**
for secure payments at charging stations under the *EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure
Regulation (AFIR)*. This approach will also be part of the upcoming *Open Charge Point
Protocol (OCPP) v2.1*. Members of the *Open Charge Alliance* can already review the
adoption of this proposal in *OCPP v2.1 Draft3 v0.53*.


## Goals

- We aim to have as many parties as possible agree that these reference
  implementations are correct interpretations of the Dynamic QR-Codes OCPP v2.1
  specification and intentions.
- Provide a collection reference implementations in different programming languages.
- Provide an extensive set of test-cases to ensure correctness.
- Provide the software as *Free Open Source* so others can freely use, test and
  extend it. We aim to make it as easy as possible for people, familiar with OCPP,
  to provide new and extended test cases.
- Collect feedback from the community.
- Expose the software functionality [online](https://open.charging.cloud)
  to make it even easier for people to test their implementations.
