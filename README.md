# Dynamic QR-Codes for EU AFIR

This project provides reference implementations for generating **Dynamic QR-Codes**
for secure payments at charging stations under the *EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure
Regulation (AFIR)*. This approach will also be part of the upcoming *Open Charge Point
Protocol (OCPP) v2.1*.


## Goals

- Provide a reference implementation
- Provide an extensive set of test-cases to ensure correctness.
- Collect feedback from the community

  We aim to have as many parties as possible agree that this reference
  implementation is a correct interpretation of the Dynamic QR-Codes OCPP v2.1
  specification and intentions.

  We welcome community contributions to this project. We aim to make it easy for
  people, familiar with OCPP, to provide new test cases.

- Provide the software as *Free Open Source* so others can freely use, test and
  extend it.

- Expose the software functionality [online](https://tools.tandemdrive.com/)
  to make it even easier for people to do calculations with the tariff
  software.
